# Traefik-Project
This is a project in which I will provide 3 EC2 instances on AWS. And I'll use Traefik as a reverse proxy for my application.

* I'll use Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and docker swarm to orchestrate the containers which will be allocated in AWS EC2 instances.
* So let's get started.
